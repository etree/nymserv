Some extremely brief instructions on setting up a hod.aarg.net style
nym server.  This assumes you already know about remailers and DNS,
and sendmail, and have already setup the appropriate DNS records
(either A or MX) to receive mail at a "nym" domain name on your
machine.

Make sure you have Perl 5.6 or later, installed with the DB_File
module.  Don't forget to run h2ph when installing perl (cd
/usr/include; h2ph *.h sys/*.h).  If you don't have DB_File, get db
from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/4bsd/db.1.85.tar.gz, install it, and
then reinstall perl so that the DB_File module is available.

Make sure you also have a Mixmaster remailer running.  You will need
to examine the $REMAIL variable and point it at your Mixmaster binary.

Create a new userid/groupid under which to run the nym.  Call it
nymuser.

Create a directory for your nym server to reside in, for example
/usr/nym.  Copy the nymserv perl script into /usr/nym, and make three
subdirectories of /usr/nym:  pgp, queue, and users.  Make sure pgp,
queue, and users are writeable by user nymuser.

Use 'su' to change to your nymserver's new user id, then create a
GnuPG key for your nymserver as follows:

   gpg --gen-key

You will want to make sure that the email addresses for the user id
cover both send@<your-nym-domain> and config@<your-nym-domain>.  For
example, the hod.aarg.net key looks like this:

   pub  1024D/9721FD57 2002-01-29 Hod Nymserver <send@hod.aarg.net>
   uid                            Hod Nymserver <config@hod.aarg.net>
   sub  1024g/9A21D444 2002-01-29

Put the key's GnuPG passphrase in the file pgp/passphrase.

Create files /usr/nym/users/postmaster.forward and
/usr/nym/users/admin.forward which contain your real email address.
Create a file users/remailer-key.reply which contains the GnuPG public
key you just created.  Create a ring prototype file by running
commands similar to those below.

   echo 'From: nobody@nym.alias.net' > users/remailer-key.reply
   echo 'Subject: PGP key for nym.alias.net' >> users/remailer-key.reply
   echo '' >> users/remailer-key.reply
   gpg --armor --export $YOUR_NEW_KEY_ID >> users/remailer-key.reply

   cp pgp/pubring.pgp ring-proto.pgp

Edit the configuration variables in the nymserver.pl script to set
your machine name, domain names, and the paths to the needed
binaries.  Make sure you've installed Crypt::OpenPGP and Digest::MD5.
Both of these can be downloaded from CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).

Crypt::OpenPGP has a great number of prerequisites.  You will want to
support as many different encryption algorithms as possible, so I
would recommend installing all of them.  Crypt::IDEA is broken,
however.  To fix it, you will need to edit IDEA.xs and change line 66
so 'sv_undef' is 'PL_sv_undef'.  Math::Pari is another module to watch
out for.  Make sure all the tests pass!  Remember, CPAN is your friend
when it comes to installing Perl modules.

If you have an A record for your nymserver, set up finger support.
Put a line like this in /etc/inetd.conf:

finger	stream	tcp	nowait	nymuser	/usr/nym/nymserv nymserv -fingerd

Finally, make a new sendmail.cf file which sends all mail to the nym
domain name through the nymserver.  What follows is an example ".mc"
file suitable for use with sendmail 8.7.5.

Here are some additional configuration tips for Postfix users supplied
by Peter Palfrader (peter@palfrader.org).  I haven't tried them, and
hopefully some other Postfix users can clarify this if it needs any fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use a transport by adding the following to etc/postfix/master.cf:

# service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command + args
#               (yes)   (yes)   (yes)   (never) (50)
nymserver unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=3DFR user=3Dnymserv argv=3D/usr/local/bin/nymserv -d $recipient

Add the following to your transport table:

nym.example.com		nymserver:

Then, add this to your main.cf:

relay_domains = ....... nym.example.com
